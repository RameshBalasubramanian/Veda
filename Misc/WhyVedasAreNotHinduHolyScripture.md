This is a common point of confusion because of how the word **"Holy Scripture"** is used in the West versus how it works in India.

The short answer is: **The Vedas are the supreme authority for Hindus, but they are not the "Daily Manual" for most Hindus.**

To understand why, we have to look at the difference between **revelation** and **practice**.
## 1. Shruti vs. Smriti (The Technical Reason)

Hindus divide their vast library of texts into two categories.

* **Shruti ("That which is heard"):** These are the **Vedas**. They are considered the "Constitution." They are the ultimate, eternal authority. However, like a legal Constitution, they are written in a very old, difficult "language" (Vedic Sanskrit) that the average person cannot easily use for daily prayer.

* **Smriti ("That which is remembered"):** These are the texts people actually read and follow daily. This includes the **Bhagavad Gita**, the **Ramayana**, the **Mahabharata**, and the **Puranas** (stories of Shiva, Vishnu, Durga).

**The Reality:** If you ask a Hindu what their holy book is, they might say the "Gita" or "Ramayana." This is because these books take the complex, abstract ideas of the Vedas and turn them into stories and ethics that a person can actually live by.

## 2. Complexity and Access

The Vedas are incredibly difficult to master.

* **Oral Tradition:** For thousands of years, the Vedas were not allowed to be written down. They had to be memorized with perfect pitch and accent.

* **Language Barrier:** The Sanskrit used in the Rig Veda is as different from modern Hindi as Old English (Beowulf) is from modern English.

* **Ritual Focus:** Much of the Vedas (Samhitas/Brahmanas) consists of highly technical instructions for fire sacrifices (Yajnas) that require a trained priest and specific materials.

## 3. The Shift to "Bhakti" (Devotion)

About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, Hinduism went through a "Bhakti Revolution."

* The Vedas focus on **Ritual** and **Philosophy** (The Head).

* The Bhakti movement focused on **Love and Devotion** (The Heart).

Most modern Hindu practices (going to temples, singing bhajans, celebrating Diwali) come from the **Puranas and Agamas**, not directly from the Vedas. While these newer traditions claim to be based on the Vedas, they are much more colorful and emotional, making them the "Holy Scriptures" in the hearts of the people.

| Feature       | The Vedas (Shruti)               | The Puranas/Gita (Smriti)               |
|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Role          | The Supreme Authority/Root      | The Practical Guide/Fruit               |
| Accessibility | Hard (Needs a teacher/scholar) | Easy (Stories/Ethics/Devotion)         |
| Daily Use     | Low (Used in weddings/funerals)| High (Daily reading/Prayers)           |
